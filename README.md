Tool and software for web design
=============


Web design has been my thing since I started working in a SEO company. I learned a lot from my trainers especially in using software and tools in web designing. Iâ€™m glad to learn all of it because I am able to use it now as a freelance web designer. 

Some of the tools I am usually using are Pixate, Affinity, [Web Design Melbourne](http://www.gmgweb.com.au) , Avocode, Sketch, Form, UXPin, Macaw, Marvel and WebFlow.
